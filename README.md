#Introduction
This package adds support to the [Sublime Text 2]("http://www.sublimetext.com/") text editor for working with [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) files.

#TODO
In no particular order:
* ~~Add snippets for most sections~~
* Add syntax coloring for pascal scripting
* Add folding support for sections
* Improve existing syntax coloring to support user defined variables, strings, defines and includes.
* ~~Make the build system a bit smarter about determining the location of ISCC.exe~~
